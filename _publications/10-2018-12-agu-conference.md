Soil evaporation plays a key role in the water cycle and energy cycle. In addition to climate modeling, understanding how soil in vertical layering affects the soil moisture distribution and evaporation has various applications in agriculture and engineering. The near-surface soil moisture and temperature are used to inversely estimate the soil hydraulic property profile. While this method has been applied by various studies for vertically homogeneous soil, uncertainty exists in estimating effective soil hydraulic properties for layered soil profiles. In this study, two layered evaporation experiments, varying in soil type (fine and coarse soil configurations), were performed using bench-scale sand-filled tanks interfaced with an open-return wind tunnel, in which the pressure-moisture variables were monitored. A multiphase numerical model was used to describe the water flow through and evaporation from the layered soil profiles, and compared with experimental data. Results show that the soil water retention behavior varies with soil textural configuration during evaporation, and this behavior cannot be captured by using the traditional formulations. Generally, the upper-most soil layer has a more predominate effect on the evaporation behavior and water content profile than the lower layer, the extent depends on the type of upper layer soil and evaporation stage (e.g. state I vs stage II). Using soil surface information of an entire drying cycle can help infer the soil property profile for certain soil textural configurations. However, in the case of coarse soil layer overlying a fine soil, the soil property profile cannot be properly inferred solely using near surface soil information, requiring additional measurements of soil moisture at some depth below the soil surface.
